# periodic-periodic-table

In a social community I'm a member of, one participant known for cooking up bad ideas proposed:

> Periodic periodic table. A periodic table that only displays one element per second, rotating through them.

This struck me an interesting proposition, since it felt inherently doable, so I figured I'd give it a shot.

I'll refer to the project as "PPT" - not to be confused with the popular PowerPoint™️ file extension.

## Approach

I wanted to add some constraints - such as:

- The end result should be viewable in a browser
- I don't want to run any hosting for this, so probably a static web page

I thought a little bit about different ways to accomplish this, and came up with stories:

    Given a User with a web browser
    When loading the PPT page
    Then they see the PPT in action

## Technology

TBD
